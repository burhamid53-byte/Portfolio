Most Spectrum-provided routers don’t support VPN apps or VPN client settings
directly, which confuses a lot of people — because a VPN on the router is one of
the cleanest ways to protect every device on your network.

In the full guide, I cover:

- whether Spectrum routers support VPN configuration (and why most don’t)
- the best workaround options (VPN router, flashing firmware, or using a VPN-enabled device)
- how to set it up without breaking your internet connection
- what to check for security, speed, and device coverage
- common issues (double NAT, firmware limits, ISP modem/router combos) and how to fix them

This article is written for people who want router-level VPN protection for
streaming devices, smart TVs, gaming consoles, and the rest of their home network —
without overcomplicating the setup.
